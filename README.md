# MedInsight
This desktop application processes CT scan images and identifies the type of tumor present. With a straightforward interface, users can upload an image and receive the tumor classification, helping streamline the diagnostic process. It is a practical tool designed to assist healthcare professionals with initial insights into medical images.

The application was developed to showcase my skills in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their application in medical image analysis.
