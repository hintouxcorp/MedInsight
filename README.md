# MedInsight
This desktop application processes CT scan images and identifies the type of tumor present. With a straightforward interface, users can upload an image and receive the tumor classification, helping streamline the diagnostic process. It is a practical tool designed to assist healthcare professionals with initial insights into medical images.

The application was developed to showcase my skills in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their application in medical image analysis.

# How to Use
Open the application and click the first button; this will load the image. Once the image is loaded, a panel with two buttons will appear. Simply click the "Identify" button to identify the loaded image. After the identification process, the result will appear above the image.
